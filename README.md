#### Starting : 
This section will have some of the resources i used when i was starting in the field of CyberSecurity and some i feel would help people out in getting their knowledge up in the field of CyberSecurity.

1. Tryhackme : https://tryhackme.com/ :
This is hands down the best resource in my humble opinion to get started with, It has a lot walkthrough boxes, guides, and teaches you the basics very well i have learnt soo soo much from Tryhackme i would highly recommend to any one starting or even to someone who is InfoSec for a while as it has contents for all skill levels.

1.1. I would highly recommend starting with the Begginer Path for which you would have to Pathy 10$ a month but its highly worth it and you get tons more things with it. 
1.2. If you dont want to get the Premium Subscription just yet try following the free path from Tryhackme which you can find here : https://blog.tryhackme.com/free_path/

2. Hackthebox Academy : https://academy.hackthebox.eu/ :
This is another resource that recently released but it is more on the paid side for most of their content but they do have some great and detailed free modules which i would highly recommend. Some of the free content includes stuff like Linux Fundamentals , Introduction to Networking, etc. 

3. Penetration Testing Student course from INE : https://checkout.ine.com/starter-pass :

This is another great resource to get started in Penteration Testing even if you have no prior background in IT, this course will help you out a lot and get you set with your Fundamentals in the field of Cybersecurity the PTS course is the course for their certification eJPT which i would highly recommend as well but it costs around 200$ for get 1 attempt which includes a free retake which is a very good price imo.

So if you are looking to get into the Field of Bug Bounty and Web Security this is a great resource to start with they have video tutorials / CTFs to test your skills and docs.
